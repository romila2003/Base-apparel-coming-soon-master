## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The Javascript of this challenge was fun and simple since I feel more comfortable with using email validation in JS. Within the mobile view, the design of the page was not too difficult however, it was hard to adjust the elements correctly as the screen size increased, particularly within tablet and desktop mode. I could not recreate the background like in the design provided and tried my best with the whole design, especially the hero image.

CSS - Background: 

```css

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
    .desktop {
        display: block;
        max-width: 100%;
        height: 100vh;
        width: 100%;
    }
}

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I need to work on with improving HTML and CSS web pages, particularly pages that include images since I sometiems struggle to make the image responsive and look identical to the design provided. Also, I should incorporate more Javascript into future projects.
